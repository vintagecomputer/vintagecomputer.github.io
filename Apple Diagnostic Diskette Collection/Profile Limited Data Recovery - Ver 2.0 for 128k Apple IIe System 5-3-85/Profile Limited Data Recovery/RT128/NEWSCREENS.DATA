                                                                                                                                                                This program will attempt to recover data from a 5 or 10 megabyte               hard disk and save the data to another 5 or 10 megabyte hard disk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Before running this program you must have a source (bad) and                    destination (good) hard disk drive connected and turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Only Apple // or Apple /// based hard disk drives can be recovered.                                                                                                                                                                             To run this program, two hard disk drives, either 5 or 10 megabyte,             must be connected BEFORE turning the system on.                                                                                                                                                                                                 One is the source or suspected bad drive, the other is the                      destination or known good drive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Insert two hard disk I/O cards in any two slots other than slot 3.              If a printer is desired, insert the printer interface card in                   slot 1 only.                                                                                                                                                    If a 10 megabyte hard disk is to be recovered, only a 10 megabyte               hard disk can be the destination disk drive.                                                                                                                                                                                                    If you have a printer connected in slot 1, the program can make                 hard copies of the names of files transferred and results of the                data recovery.                                                                                                                                                  If you wish a printed report, make sure that the printer is connected,          turned on, and correctly configured or the program will not continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           If you want to use a printer, the printer interface card must be                installed before turning the system on.                                                                                                                         The printer interface card must be in slot 1.                                                                                                                   Make sure that the printer is connected, turned on, selected or                 online, and correctly configured or the program will not continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              If you do not wish to use a printer, just type N or No, and the program         will not generate a printed report.
